# Analyzing The Gaming Industry Over Time
## Utilizing R & Adobe Illustrator

### Summary
As an avid gamer when I discovered the Video Game Sales dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) I was excited to see what different forms of visualizations I could create. In regards to the overall presentation, I wanted to embrace the culture of video games from a stylistic point of view and opted for a retro-themed color scheme and image style.
